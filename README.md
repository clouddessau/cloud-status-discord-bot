- `/togglestatus` command to toggle the status (for admins only)

## Roadmap

- Integration of a planned extension of the [cloud] status to inform about current activities in the [cloud] (e.g. monday pitch, game night, etc.)
- `/setstatus` command to explicitly set the [cloud] status to a specific value
